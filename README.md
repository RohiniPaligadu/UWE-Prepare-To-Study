# UWE-Prepare-To-Study
1. Mean Test – Write a C program that can generate 1000 random numbers and calculate the mean. The final output should give a result close to 4.5.
2. Frequency Test – Write a C program that can generate 10,000 random numbers. Use an array to count the occurrence of each digit (0 through to 9). The final output should show that the occurrence of each digit is close to 10%.
3. Odd-Even Test – As exercise 2, however this time divide the numbers into odd and even groups. The final output should show 50% in each group.
4. Serial Test - Write a C program that can generate 10,000 pairs of random numbers (e.g., 02, 14). Use an array to count the occurrence of pairs of digits (00
through to 99). The final output should show that the occurrence of each pair is close to 1%.
